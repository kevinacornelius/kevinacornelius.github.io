    <div class="column">
        <p>Written and released between June and October 2018, <em>piano music</em> is a collection of original piano pieces.  The album is my first foray into writing music for piano.</p>
        <ul><li><em>Songs</em> is a collection of five unrelated musical works in which I gently experiment with harmony and style.</li><li><em>Echo</em> takes a melody and harmonizes it with the same melody an octave lower and displaced by three beats.</li><li><em>Late Afternoon Thoughts in the Sun</em> begins a transition in the album from academic exploration to creating moods. <em>Late Afternoon Thoughts in the Sun</em> captures the essence of being in deep thought in the late afternoon sun.</li><li><em>Choosing Something Else</em> is a whimsical response to people suggesting that I follow a stable, non-music career: "Thanks for your suggestions. I am going to do things my own way and choose something else, a path of my own choosing."</li><li><em>Window View</em> exudes the joy that I experienced each time I looked out of the windows of my former Jersey City, NJ apartment.</li><li>Derived from an English Horn theme in an orchestral movement I had once drafted, <em>Finding Center</em> brings the album to a pensive, self-reflective conclusion. </li></ul>
